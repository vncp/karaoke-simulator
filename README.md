#Movimento
A simple, aesthetic journaling app. 
Movimentum is the Latin word for momentum.

**Desription**
My first React project using Django and Material UI elements. Did in a day after one day of learning JS/React.
There's still a lot to improve and many things I want to add. I will probably refactor the code and use more of React's capabilities as I progress.

The backend is Django which routes to the React frontend. Entry creation does an API call to a Django APIView.
